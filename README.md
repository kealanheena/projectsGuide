# Projects Guide

This is a collection of some of the projects that I've done after graduating from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). I also completed a lot of projects throughout my time spent at Makers. If you're interested you can check out some of them in my [Makers Portfolio Repository](https://github.com/kealanheena/makersPortfolio).
