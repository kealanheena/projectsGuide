# Projects Guide

This is a collection of some of the projects that I've done after graduating from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). I also completed a lot of projects throughout my time spent at Makers. If you're interested you can check out some of them in my [Makers Portfolio Repository](https://github.com/kealanheena/makersPortfolio).

## [Studio Ghibli API](https://github.com/kealanheena/studio_ghibli_api)

This is an app that displays all of the Studio Ghibli movies as well as their rating and release date using an API. You can change the order they are displayed in, you can choose to organise them by alphabetical order, rating(highest to lowest) and release date(newest to oldest).
I did this project so that I could get a better grasp on how API's work so I grabbed a Studio Ghibli API amd run with it. I messed around with the API trying different ways of getting and formating the imformation until I understood it. I used Ruby because I had used JavaScript to collect infomation from an API before and wanted to try something different.
